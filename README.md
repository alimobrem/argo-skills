## Install

```shell
# Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add alimobrem/skills-for-argo
/plugin install openshift-gitops@openshift

# Any other agent — Codex, Cline, Amp, Cursor, Antigravity, and 15 more
npx skills add alimobrem/skills-for-argo
```

Then just describe what you need — skills activate on context, you never name them:

```text
"Audit this repo for GitOps best practices"
"Why is my Application stuck OutOfSync?"
"Generate an ApplicationSet with a git directory generator"
```

Skills are plain Markdown with YAML frontmatter, so they are not tied to one agent.
`npx skills` is the [vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI — it
reads this repo directly and installs into whichever agent directories it finds.

<details>
<summary><b>Prerequisites</b></summary>

**Required** — `kubectl` **or** `oc`.

**Optional**, each unlocking more capability:

| Tool | Adds |
|------|------|
| `kustomize` | overlay builds during repo audits |
| `kubeconform` | schema validation against Argo CRDs |
| `yq` | YAML-aware parsing and duplicate detection |
| `argocd` | richer Application debugging and sync operations |
| `kubectl-argo-rollouts` | Rollout status and promotion |

```shell
brew bundle     # installs all of the above on macOS
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Codex</b> — manual marketplace entry</summary>

Add to `$REPO_ROOT/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` or `~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "openshift-gitops",
  "category": "Developer Tools",
  "source": {
    "source": "url",
    "url": "https://github.com/alimobrem/skills-for-argo.git",
    "ref": "main"
  },
  "policy": {
    "installation": "AVAILABLE",
    "authentication": "ON_INSTALL"
  }
}
```

Or just use `npx skills add` above, which handles Codex too.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>GitHub Copilot</b></summary>

```shell
mkdir -p .github/copilot
cp agents/github-copilot/argocd.agent.md .github/copilot/
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code notes</b></summary>

After install the `argocd` agent appears in `/agents` and the 6 GitOps skills activate on
context. Run `/reload-plugins` if they do not appear immediately.

<summary><b>🔵 GitOps</b> — Argo CD, Argo Rollouts · <b>6 skills</b>, benchmarked</summary>

> **Scope — Red Hat OpenShift GitOps.** These skills cover Argo CD and Argo Rollouts as
> shipped and supported by the OpenShift GitOps operator, including the operator-managed
> CRDs (`ArgoCD`, `RolloutManager`, `NotificationsConfiguration`, `NamespaceManagement`,
> `ImageUpdater`). They work against vanilla Argo CD too, but OpenShift GitOps is the

<sub>Targets Red Hat OpenShift GitOps 1.19+ · Argo CD v2.14+ / v3.x · Argo Rollouts v1.8+.
Measured against OpenShift GitOps 1.21.3 / Argo CD v3.4.5.</sub>

### How the Skills Work Together

The agent automatically selects the right skill based on what you ask:

```
 Ask a question ────► argo-knowledge           "How do I...?"
 Audit a repo ──────► argo-repo-audit          "Audit this repo"
 Debug a cluster ───► argo-cluster-debug       "Why is X failing?"
 Make a change ─────► argo-operations          "Install / create / promote / upgrade..."
 Tune performance ──► argo-performance-tuning  "Why is this slow at scale?"
 Onboard a team ────► argo-team-onboard        "Set up a new team on Argo CD"
```

You don't need to invoke skills manually — just describe what you need.

### Knowledge — Ask Questions & Generate YAML

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/knowledge-preview.svg" alt="Knowledge Preview" width="820"/>
</p>

Use when you need to understand OpenShift GitOps concepts or generate manifests.

```text
# Generate manifests
Generate a multi-source Application that combines a Helm chart from
oci://registry.example.com/myapp with values from a Git repo.

# Architecture guidance
What's the best way to structure a multi-cluster GitOps repo?
Should I use app-of-apps or ApplicationSet?

# Newer features
How do I set up argocd-agent for 200 edge clusters behind firewalls?
How do I run Applications in any namespace for multi-tenancy?

# OpenShift-specific
Generate an ArgoCD CR for the OpenShift GitOps operator with OAuth and Routes.

### Repo Audit — Security & Best Practice Review

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/audit-preview.svg" alt="Audit Report Preview" width="820"/>
</p>

Use when you want to validate a GitOps repo before deploying or during a review.

```text
# Full audit
Audit the current repo and provide a GitOps report.

# Targeted checks
Check for security issues in my AppProject configurations.
Are there any hardcoded secrets in Helm values?
Do my Applications have proper sync retry configuration?

# Validation only
Just validate YAML syntax and schemas, don't do a full audit.
```

**What it catches:**

| Severity | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| Critical | Wildcard `*` in AppProject sourceRepos/destinations, plain-text Secrets, hardcoded passwords in Helm values, `clusterResourceWhitelist: */*` |
| Warning | Missing syncPolicy, `targetRevision: HEAD` in production, no retry/backoff, missing `ignoreDifferences` for controller-managed fields |
| Info | Missing `ignoreDifferences` for HPA-managed replicas, no progressive sync on multi-cluster ApplicationSets |

### Cluster Debug — Troubleshoot Live Issues

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/debug-preview.svg" alt="Debug Report Preview" width="820"/>
</p>

Use when something is broken or you want a health check.

```text
# Health check
Check if Argo CD is properly installed on my cluster.

# Application issues
Why is my Application podinfo stuck in OutOfSync?
Debug the degraded Application in the production namespace.

# Rollout issues
The canary rollout for frontend is stuck at step 2. Why?
Are my AnalysisTemplates actually testing anything meaningful?

# Multi-tenant review
Compare all ArgoCD instances on this cluster and check for security gaps.

# Deep investigation
Inspect all Rollouts on this cluster and give me a health report.
Review the Argo CD configuration for security concerns.
```

### Operations — Install, Deploy, Promote, Maintain

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/operations-preview.svg" alt="Operations Preview" width="820"/>
</p>

Use when you want to make changes. Writes are specified to follow a five-step gate:
**Generate** → **Preview** with a server-side dry-run → **Blast radius** → **Confirm** →
**Verify**. The agent stops at Confirm and waits for you.

```text
# Setup
Install Argo CD on my OpenShift cluster using the GitOps operator.
Create an AppProject for the frontend team with restricted access.
Add the staging cluster to Argo CD.

# Deploy
Create an Application for my Helm chart with automated sync.
Create an ApplicationSet with git directory generator and progressive syncs.
Set up Slack notifications for sync failures.

# Promote
Promote the canary rollout frontend in production.
Sync the Application with server-side apply.
Abort the failing rollout and retry.

# Maintain
Upgrade Argo CD to the latest version.
Back up all my Applications and AppProjects to YAML files.
Rotate the Git credentials for the infra repo.
```

See **[Safety model](#safety-model)** for the full protocol.

### Performance Tuning — Diagnose & Fix Slowness at Scale

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/performance-preview.svg" alt="Performance Tuning Preview" width="820"/>
</p>

Use when OpenShift GitOps is slow, resource-hungry, or struggling at scale.

```text
# Repo-server under pressure
Our argocd-repo-server keeps getting OOMKilled every time we push to our
  500-application monorepo.

# UI/controller sluggishness
The Argo CD UI feels sluggish and drift detection takes forever with 2,000 apps.

# Multi-cluster scaling
We have 20 clusters registered but only one application-controller pod and
  it's maxed out on CPU.

# Timeout errors
Users see "context deadline exceeded" opening an Application with a huge Helm chart.

# Git provider limits
Our GitHub org is rate-limiting us — 500 apps all point at the same repo and branch.

# Reconciliation churn (no real drift)
Our controller CPU is constantly high even though every Application shows
  Synced/Healthy — nothing in Git has changed.
```

Diagnoses the bottleneck first — including whether the controller is reconciling for the
right reasons at all (`resource.ignoreResourceUpdatesEnabled`, `resource.exclusions`,
per-Application `manifest-generate-paths` cache scoping for monorepos) before reaching for
repo-server concurrency, controller processors, sharding (static or Dynamic Cluster
Distribution), or Git rate-limits — then applies the same **Generate → Preview → Confirm**
safety model as Operations before changing anything live.

### Team Onboarding — Set Up New Teams on Argo CD

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/onboarding-preview.svg" alt="Onboarding Preview" width="820"/>
</p>

Use when you need to onboard app teams onto Argo CD. The skill discovers what
each team already has (CI, registry, source type) and generates only the Argo CD
pieces — no assumptions about your stack.

**Onboarding output is a commit, not a `kubectl apply`.** The tenant boundary —
AppProject, RBAC, namespace, quotas, NetworkPolicies — is GitOps config like anything
else, so the skill writes it to your GitOps repo and hands off to Argo CD to reconcile.
Applying it directly would put the boundary outside Git: invisible in review, missing
from the audit trail, and reverted the next time anything reconciles. The only exception
is a one-time bootstrap when no control loop exists yet, and the skill names it as such.

The recommended model follows Thomas Jungbauer's
[project onboarding with GitOps and Helm](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/project-onboarding-using-gitops-and-helm):
onboarding a tenant means adding one small `values.yaml`, which a shared onboarding chart
renders and an ApplicationSet discovers. Committing rendered manifests or Kustomize
overlays is also supported.

```text
# Single team onboarding
Onboard the payments team. They use Kustomize, deploy from
https://github.com/acme/payments.git, need dev/staging/prod namespaces.

# Helm-based team
Onboard analytics — they deploy a Helm chart from OCI registry
oci://registry.acme.com/charts/analytics with values in a separate config repo.

# Self-service at scale
Set up self-service onboarding so teams can add themselves via PR.

# Multi-environment with promotion
Onboard the checkout team with gitops-promoter gating dev → staging → prod.
Production should require manual approval.
```

**What it generates:**

| Resource | When | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| AppProject | Always | Security boundary — scoped sourceRepos, destinations, RBAC |
| Application | Always | Points to team's repo with correct source type (Helm/Kustomize/directory) |
| RBAC role | Always | Project-scoped permissions for team's SSO group |
| Namespace | Always | With Pod Security Standards (`enforce: restricted`) and monitoring labels |
| NetworkPolicies | Always | Default-deny egress (with DNS allowed) plus router, monitoring, and same-namespace ingress — without these the namespace is open to every pod on the cluster |
| ResourceQuota + LimitRange | If needed | Capacity limits, via t-shirt size or explicit values |
| PromotionStrategy | If multi-env | Branch-per-environment promotion with health gates |
| ApplicationSet | If self-service | Per-tenant values discovered by a `**/values.yaml` git generator |

**What it refuses:**

| Request | Response |
|---------|----------|
| `sourceRepos: '*'` | Lists repos explicitly — wildcards defeat multi-tenancy |
| `clusterResourceWhitelist: '*/*'` | Scopes to specific CRD groups needed |
| `exec` permission | Redirects to kubectl exec with scoped RBAC |
| Hardcoded secrets | References ExternalSecret or SealedSecret patterns |
| "Just apply it to the cluster" | Explains the drift cost and offers the commit path; proceeds only if it's a genuine bootstrap, and commits the same manifests alongside |

</details>

## How it works

A skill is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter. No runtime, no service, no daemon.

```
skills/gitops/argo-cluster-debug/
├── SKILL.md        # always in context once the skill activates — kept short
├── references/     # loaded only when the workflow calls for them
└── scripts/        # deterministic checks the agent runs instead of improvising
```

The agent picks a skill by matching your request against its `description`, so you never
invoke one by name — you describe the problem and the right expertise loads. Reference
files stay out of context until needed, which is why a skill can carry hundreds of lines
of operator-specific detail without consuming the window.

Where being exactly right matters, the skill runs a **script** rather than describing a
procedure. A documented command can be followed loosely; `scripts/validate.sh` cannot.

## Benchmarks

**Every skill in this repo is measured against an unaided baseline** — same model, same
prompts, same live cluster, no access to `skills/`. Graded blind: the grader sees
"Condition A" and "Condition B" and is not told which is which.

That bar applies to every product, not just the one that has skills today. A skill with
no measured baseline is a guess, and this repo does not publish guesses — including when
the answer is unflattering.

<details open>
<summary><b>🔵 GitOps</b> — 6 skills, 584 expectations per condition</summary>

| Skill | with-skill | baseline | delta | |
|-------|-----------:|---------:|------:|---|
| [`argo-performance-tuning`](benchmarks/argo-performance-tuning.md) | **96.7%** | 64.0% | **+32.7** | |
| [`argo-operations`](benchmarks/argo-operations.md) | **96.4%** | 81.6% | **+14.8** | |
| [`argo-repo-audit`](benchmarks/argo-repo-audit.md) | **97.0%** | 85.4% | **+11.6** | |
| [`argo-cluster-debug`](benchmarks/argo-cluster-debug.md) | 97.5% | 92.6% | +4.9 | *unresolved* |
| [`argo-team-onboard`](benchmarks/argo-team-onboard.md) | 89.4% | 84.6% | +4.8 | *unresolved* |
| [`argo-knowledge`](benchmarks/argo-knowledge.md) | 98.5% | 93.9% | +4.5 | *unresolved* |
| **Weighted overall** | **95.9%** | **83.4%** | **+12.5** | |

**The delta tracks how product-specific a skill is.** Performance tuning — exact setting
names, defaults the operator silently overrides, which CR field actually wins — gains
most. General Argo CD knowledge the model already has gains least.

**Half the skills land under the noise floor, and we publish that.** Regrading identical
text with a fresh grader moved scores by up to 7 points, so anything under ~5 points is
treated as unresolved rather than as a win. Three of six sit there. A skill can be
genuinely good and still not be *measurably* better than a competent unaided agent, and
those two statements are easy to confuse.

**Giving the test cluster the resources the prompts describe moved the baseline more than
the skill.** `argo-cluster-debug`'s evals used to name objects that did not exist, so both
arms were capped on anything needing a real finding. After deploying fixtures the skill
arm rose 92.6% → 97.5% and the baseline rose 86.1% → 92.6% — so the delta *fell* from
+6.6 to +4.9 and dropped below the floor. Read plainly: a good part of what looked like
skill advantage was really the skill handling *absent* resources more gracefully. When
the resources are there, an unaided engineer does nearly as well.

**Fixing a bad eval can lower the score, and did — twice.** `argo-repo-audit`'s
expectations could not tell a correct root cause from a confident wrong one; rewriting
them cut its delta from +16.2 to +11.6 by crediting baseline work the vague wording had
denied. Numbers that only ever move upward when you improve your own measuring
instrument are a warning sign. These moved both ways.

No skills yet, so nothing to measure. When they land they are held to the same bar:
a strong unaided baseline on the same prompts, blind grading, per-expectation scoring
with evidence, and the numbers published whichever way they come out.

before quoting any of these numbers.

## Safety model

The first question most platform teams ask is *"will this let an agent break my cluster?"*

**The honest answer first: these skills are instructions, not a sandbox.** They tell the
agent to stop and ask before writing, and in measured runs it does. But a Markdown
instruction is followed *most* of the time, not *always* — we have a run where a
documented step was skipped, and the eval caught it. The guarantee you can actually rely
on is the one outside this repo: **the agent can do nothing your `kubeconfig` cannot.**
Scope its RBAC to what you are willing to let it change, and treat everything below as
defence in depth rather than the perimeter.

With that said — **every write is specified to follow the same five steps, stopping at
step 4.**

**1 · Generate** — produces the manifest or command and shows it in full. Nothing runs.

**2 · Preview** — `kubectl diff` for an update, `--dry-run=server --validate=strict` for a
create.
> Never `--dry-run=client`. It validates nothing, and for an update it only echoes your
> input back — it cannot show what would change.

**3 · Blast radius** — resolves what *else* the change touches.
> A diff shows one object. Most Argo CD objects are fan-out points: a one-field edit to an
> `ArgoCD` CR restarts components that every Application on the instance depends on.
> This step names how many Applications stop reconciling, which tenants share the
> instance, and what gets deleted.

**4 · Confirm** — asks explicitly, and waits. Destructive operations require typing the
resource name.

**5 · Verify** — after applying, checks it actually worked and reports the result.

Read-only work — audits, status checks, backups — skips the gate entirely.

**Recommendations carry impact too, not just urgency.** A skill that tells you to raise a
memory limit also tells you that doing so restarts the server and interrupts everyone on
that instance. "How soon" is the easy half; "what else moves" is the half you cannot work
out from the recommendation alone.

```
BLOCKER — Delete Rollout/openshift-gitops/example (no containers; hot-loops the controller)
  Impact: argo-rollouts controller only. The Rollout is invalid so nothing runs from
          it; no workload is affected. Controller restarts once.
```

Three skills (`repo-audit`, `cluster-debug`, `performance-tuning` in diagnosis mode)
contain no write operations at all, so for those the gate never has to fire. If you want
that enforced rather than specified, run the agent with a read-only `kubeconfig` — the
skills behave identically and the question stops being a matter of trust.

## Data and privacy

**The skills send nothing anywhere.** They are inert Markdown and shell scripts in your
checkout — there is no telemetry, no callback, no account.

Be clear about what *your agent* does, though: when it reads cluster state to answer a
question, that output becomes part of the conversation with whichever model you are
using. That is a property of using an AI coding agent at all, not of these skills, but it
is worth knowing before pointing one at a production cluster.

Practical consequences:

- Three skills (`repo-audit`, `cluster-debug`, and `performance-tuning` while diagnosing)
  specify only read operations — no create, apply, patch or delete anywhere in them.
  That is a property of the instructions, not an enforced sandbox; see
  [Safety model](#safety-model).
- The agent acts with **your** credentials and can do nothing your `kubeconfig` cannot.
  This is the only hard limit in the list, and it is the one worth configuring.
- `repo-audit` runs `kubeconform` with `-skip=Secret`, so Secret contents are not sent
  through schema validation.
- **`repo-audit` reports credential locations, not values.** It runs
  `scan-credentials.sh`, which prints file, line, key name and value *length* — enough to
  triage and to find the string yourself, not enough to use it. This replaced a
  documented `grep` that printed whole matching lines; an audit run put a decoded
  username and password into the transcript before it was fixed. The scanner also
  separates real plaintext from SOPS/SealedSecret ciphertext and from values marked
  `# notsecret` or `EXAMPLE-`.
- **That is a property of the script, not a guarantee about the agent.** The skill
  instructs it never to `cat` a Secret or `base64 -d` a value, and the scanner leaks
  nothing by construction — but an agent asked point-blank to show a secret can still
  read the file. Audit a repo holding live credentials with the same care you would give
  to opening that file.

Two guards worth knowing about, because they catch the mistakes that actually happened here:

- **`make test-registration`** — a new skill cannot be added without being wired into the
  marketplace manifest, agent definition, Makefile eval targets, banner, README and eval
  workflow. The banner silently lagged two skills behind before this existed.
- **`make test-expectations`** — resolves every `spec.*` path asserted in an eval against
  the committed CRD schemas. Three expectations were found grading *for* manifests the API
  server rejects or prunes; this stops that recurring.

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the repo layout, skill conventions, and eval runner instructions.

## Support

**This is a community project. It is not a Red Hat product and carries no Red Hat
support.** There is no SLA, no guaranteed response, and no entitlement attached to it.

- Questions, bugs and feature requests: open a [GitHub issue](../../issues).
- Contributions are welcome — see [docs/adding-a-skill.md](docs/adding-a-skill.md).
- Fixes land on a best-effort basis, by whoever has time.

Using these skills does **not** affect the support status of your OpenShift or OpenShift
GitOps subscription. They generate manifests and run read-only commands against your
cluster; nothing here modifies a supported component's configuration without you
approving the change first.

For supported OpenShift GitOps guidance, use
[Red Hat documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_gitops)
and a support case.
